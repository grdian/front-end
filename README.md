# Grdian

Grdian is an app that allows users to build a network of trusted friends and quickly send out requests for help when they are in trouble

# Usage

When opening the application, a user will be greeted with a login screen requesting an email address and a password. If the user does not have an account yet, they can create one by clicking on sign up/new account.

# Sending an alert

To send an alert, simply click on the prominent "Alert Grdians" button at the top of the home page. A user can then click "send alert" to instantly send a default message to their network, or they can add a message and urgency level before clicking "send alert" for a customized alert.
